# Spin-AI

Spin-AI is a prototype being actively developed to model inelastic neutron scattering data. It is construct by interfering an auto encoder with a feed-forward neural network.

# Motivation - $Yb_2O_3$

The $Yb_2O_3$ is a binary system with complex chiral structural. The $Yb$ is the only magnetic ion in the system yet they occupy two different symmetry sites. The spin Hamiltonian
is governed by two exchange interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$. Symmetry allows 12 free parameters to poppulate two 3 $\times$ 3 matrices for the exchange interactions. Fitting these
parameters with inelastic neutron scattering data has been challenging.
